</p>

<h2>School</h2>
<p>I'm student at <a href="http://fit.cvut.cz/en" target="_blank">Czech technical university in Prague, faluty of IT</a>. That is one of best technical universities in Europe for sure (see the <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/node/9268/ranking-details/university-subject-rankings/2013" target="_blank">ranking</a>). I study Bachelor programme with specialization <a href="http://fit.cvut.cz/en/student/bachelor/web-and-multimedia" target="_blank">Web and Multimedia</a>.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I'm currently looking for a job and working on my privat projects. My last employer was <a href="http://www.3sixty.eu/" target="_blank">3sixty s.r.o.</a></p>

<h2>Baseball</h2>
<p>I'm left-handed reliefer and firstbaseman currently playing <a href="http://www.baseball.cz/modules.php?op=modload&name=liga&file=index&do=tab&akce=219&pda=2&admina=" target="_blank">Extraleague</a> (top league in Czech) for <a href="http://titans.cz" target="_blank">Tempo Titans Prague</a>. I joined Tempo organization in 2001 and since that time I've earned a lot of responsibilities and functions in the club. I began coaching baseball in 2007 and I was elected a club board member two years later. I was elected a team captain two years ago and granted promotion to the Extraleague last fall.
